# Car tracking

GREY_DIFF_TRACKING - tracking object based on difference between frames in grayscale. After detecting a obj, we assume that it is a car in this example and we track it by it's position. 

YOLO_part folder - here implements object recognition on video based on yolo detection. Nothing special. Planty examples already on internet.
